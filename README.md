# burger
This is an application for adding and eating virtual burgers. 

You can add any type of burger that you'd like to eat into the input section and click the "Add Burger" button. From there, the burger will render onto the screen. If you would like to eat the burger, hit the "Devour it!" button and the burger will move to the bottom of the page, along with the other eaten burgers. 

Burgers are matched by their ID in the MySQL database to trigger the click event for burgers to be added and eaten according to their name. 
This is a server page that is run using a Local Host 8080 through clicking "node server.js" into the terminal.

The website uses Handlebars, and follows the MVC system to organize how the front end and backend communicate with eachother.
